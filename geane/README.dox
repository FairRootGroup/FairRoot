========

The [GEANE](http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/119/3/032018) allows particle trajectory transport (the track parameters and errors) through the given geometry and magnetic fields. The GEANE was originally part of the [Geant3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEANT-3) Monte Carlo tranport package. Standalone GEANE was developed to help track finding and fitting in the analysis stages. 

The CMake target name for this library is `FairRoot::Geane`.
