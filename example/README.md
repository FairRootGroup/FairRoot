#Examples

##Tutorial1:
How to implement a simple detector using the old ASCII interface to describe the geometry (see Detector Geometry and Media for more details about this geometry interface)
See also Adding new detector for a detailed description of the detector class implementation, MC point class and the CMakeLists.txt

To run this tutorial:

After building FairRoot successfully go to the build directory and call the configuration script (config.sh or config.csh according to our shell)
cd to the Tutorial1/macros directory
run the following command: root run_tutorial1.C (you can also load the macro into root and then run it)
This will start a simulation session with Geant3 and create 10 events generated by a box generator, the input in the box generator can be chosen by the user, by default in this macro we use "pions" (see macro lines 20-22) for details.
To choose Geant4 you just have to change TGeant3 to TGeant4 in line 8 of the macro, or of you are loading the macro to root before exciting it you just give TGeant4 as second argument to the run_tutorial1 call, i.e:

```bash
root>.L run_tutorial1.C
root>run_tutorial(10, "TGeant4")
```

##Tutorial2

This example show you how to:

Simulate a simple detector (run_tutorial2.C)
Read the simulated data, and the digitization parameters from "parameters/tutdet.digi.par" and create digitized data (create_digis.C)
Read the digitized data for further reconstruction (read_digis.C)

##Tutorial3
This example demonstrate

detector simulation
event by event digitization
time based digitization
Message Queue based reconstruction: The Message Queue based reconstruction demonstrates the usage of FairMQ.
Any number of "sampler" processes (FairMQSampler, FairMQSamplerTask, TestDetectorDigiLoader) send the data generated in the digitization step to a number of "processor" processes which do the reconstruction with the data (FairMQProcessor, FairMQProcessorTask, FairTestDetectorMQRecoTask). After the reconstruction task, the processes send the output data to a number of "sink" processes, which write the data to disk (FairMQFileSink).
All the communication between these processes is done via FairMQ and can be configured to run over network (tcp) or on a local machine with inter-process communication (ipc).
Currently, the number of processes and their parameters are configured with bash scripts/command line parameters. The scripts are located in the macro directory, together with README.md for more details on how to configure them.
Event display
##Tutorial4
This example demonstrate:

using ROOT geometry as input for detector description, i.e: the geometry is created and saved to a ROOT file from a macro ( Create_Tutorial4_Geometry.C). The ROOT file is read by the detector classes during simulation
##Tutorial5
Shows how to use FairDB interface to write and read parameter to a database system.
Two type of parameter classes are implemented with

simple data members ( FairDbTutPar)
complex data members i.e ROOT object ( FairDbTutParBin)
In both cases, corresponding macro to read and write as well as a script.
To setup the database to be used (dbconfig.sh) are available from the macro directory.
