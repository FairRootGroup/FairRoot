eventdisplay
========

Base classes for the event display, which allows:

- checking the simulated detector geometry;
- inspecting the signals in the detector (deriving from FairMCPoint or FairHit);
- viewing the simulated particles' trajectories (if SetStoreTraj was enabled during Monte Carlo simulations).
