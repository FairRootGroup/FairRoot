# GoTutorial

`GoTutorial` shows how one can mix and mash devices written in `C++` and devices written in `Go`, exchanging data over `nanomsg`.

- `go-sink` is a sink, written in `Go`
- `go-processor` is a processor, written in `Go`

They are meant to be used with the `C++` devices shown in `MQ/1-sampler-sink` and `MQ/2-sampler-processor-sink`.
